For the current path, it models how long it will take to pay off your debt with compound interest, showing total costs and timeline. For the relief path, it estimates potential settlement amounts based on your debt age, payment status, and other factors, then calculates monthly payments and total program costs including settlement company fees. The tool provides a side-by-side comparison so you can see potential monthly savings, total debt reduction, and time to becoming debt-free under each scenario."},{question:"What information do I need to use this calculator?",answer:"You'll need to provide 12 pieces of information to get your estimate. Financial details include your total unsecured debt amount, current monthly minimum payments, average interest rate, and the type of debt (credit cards, medical, etc.). You'll also indicate your oldest debt's age and current payment status. Personal financial information includes your employment status, monthly household income, and essential monthly expenses. Optionally, you can indicate any hardship circumstances you've experienced. Finally, to see your results, you'll provide basic contact information (name, email, phone). Having recent credit card statements or loan documents handy makes the process faster, but you can estimate if exact numbers aren't immediately available."},{question:"How long does it take to get my estimate?",answer:"Most people complete the calculator in 2-3 minutes. The tool uses a 12-question flow designed to be quick while gathering the information needed for accurate estimates. Each question is straightforward—many use sliders or dropdown menus for faster input. You can move back and forth between questions if you need to review or change answers. Once you complete all questions and submit, your personalized estimate appears immediately on screen. There's no waiting period, email verification, or credit check required. The entire process from start to viewing your results typically takes less than five minutes, even if you need to look up exact figures from statements."},{question:"How accurate is my debt relief estimate?",answer:"Our estimates are based on industry data, settlement patterns, and mathematical modeling reviewed by a Certified Public Accountant. However, accuracy depends on factors the calculator cannot predict. The settlement percentages we use reflect historical averages from FTC and CFPB data—what creditors have typically accepted. Your actual results will vary based on whether your specific creditors agree to negotiate, what settlement percentage they'll accept, how your financial situation evolves during a program, and whether you can maintain payments throughout the process. Think of the estimate as an educated projection based on thousands of similar cases, not a guarantee. The math is correct, but real-world outcomes depend on creditor participation and your individual circumstances."},{question:"Do I have to opt in to use the calculator?",answer:"No. You can use the calculator and view your complete results without opting in to anything. The calculator's purpose is education—helping you understand potential debt relief scenarios before making any decisions. At the final step, you'll provide contact information to see your results, but there's an optional consent checkbox if you'd like to receive a one-time phone call to discuss your estimate. This consent is explicitly optional and clearly marked. You can check it or leave it unchecked—either way, you'll see your full results. Consent is not a condition of using the calculator. We believe you should understand your options first, then decide if you want to speak with someone."},{question:"What happens after I complete the calculator?",answer:"After completing all 12 questions, you'll immediately see your personalized results screen showing a side-by-side comparison of your current path versus potential relief path, estimated monthly savings and total debt reduction, projected timeline to becoming debt-free, and an explanation of how we calculated your specific estimates. Based on your situation, you may see either a phone number to call a debt relief specialist (if your profile suggests settlement might be beneficial) or an optional form to request a consultation (for exploratory cases). You're never obligated to take any action—the results are educational. If you opted in for contact, a representative may call to discuss your estimate. If you didn't opt in, that's the end of the process unless you choose to reach out."},{question:"What's the difference between 'Current Path' and 'Relief Path'?",answer:"The Current Path shows what happens if you continue making minimum payments on your debt without seeking relief. We calculate how long it takes to pay off your debt with compound interest, the total amount you'll pay (principal plus all interest), and your monthly payment amount. This path assumes nothing changes—same interest rates, same minimum payments. The Relief Path models a debt settlement scenario where you work with a settlement company to negotiate reduced balances with your creditors. This calculation factors in typical settlement percentages based on your debt age and payment status, settlement company fees (usually 20-25% of enrolled debt), and a realistic monthly payment based on your disposable income. The side-by-side comparison shows potential savings and trade-offs between these approaches."},{question:"Does my estimate include settlement company fees?",answer:"Yes. All cost estimates in the Relief Path include settlement company fees, which typically range from 20-25% of your enrolled debt amount. Many calculators show only the settled debt amount, making relief programs look cheaper than they actually are. We include fees because we want you to see the complete financial picture. Our estimates show the settled amount (what you'll pay creditors), the settlement company fees, and the total program cost (both combined). This transparency means your estimated 'total reduction' accounts for fees—it's your true savings compared to paying debts in full. When you see potential savings on the results screen, those numbers already factor in all costs, not just the negotiated debt reduction."}],c={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:l.map(e=>({"@type":"Question",name:e.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:e.answer}}))};return(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"national-tool-page",children:[(0,a.jsx)("style",{children:"\n
