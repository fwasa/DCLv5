3:T414,Prince Edward Island residents should understand several factors before choosing debt relief. First, PEI has homestead exemption provisions that protect a portion of home equity in bankruptcy. Second, Prince Edward Island allows wage garnishment for consumer debts under specific regulations. Third, PEI's 6-year statute of limitations gives creditors extended time to pursue legal collection. Fourth, Prince Edward Island is Canada's smallest province with a population under 200,000, and its economy has significant seasonal variation with tourism being a major industry. Settlement programs require consistent 24-48 month payments, so assess income stability particularly if employed in seasonal sectors. PEI has relatively low cost of living. Verify any settlement company complies with Prince Edward Island law and check for complaints. The calculator shows complete costs including fees (typically 20-25% of enrolled debt) transparently. Consider consulting a PEI-licensed attorney or Licensed Insolvency Trustee to evaluate your options.5:["state","prince-edward-island","d"]
